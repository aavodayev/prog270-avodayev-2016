# Non-Team Sports

# _Tennis_

<p> Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single
opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each
player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber
ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The
object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not
able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will
not gain a point, while the opposite player will. For this sport there is no
official league but more rather is comprised of tennis tours and tournaments </p>

# _Boxing_

Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture
in most international gamesâ€”it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is
supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called
rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue
by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a
towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at
the end of the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from
the judges, the fight is considered a draw (professional boxing). In Olympic
boxing, due to the fact that a winner must be declared, in the case of a draw,
the judges use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the
bout. </p>


## Weight Class

<p>
In boxing, a weight class is a standardized weight range for boxers. The lower
limit of a weight class is equal to the upper weight limit of the class below
it. The top class, with no upper limit, is called heavyweight in professional
boxing and super heavyweight[1] in amateur boxing. A boxing match is usually
scheduled for a fixed weight class, and each boxer's weight must not exceed the
upper limit. Although professional boxers may fight above their weight class, an
amateur boxer's weight must not fall below the lower limit. A nonstandard
weight limit is called a catch weight. </p>
