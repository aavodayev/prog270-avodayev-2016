# Background

As a child I have always had a fascination with sports. From running, to swimming,
to playing team sports, I have always found sports to be relaxing and fun and not
a task to complete. At times it was hard and at other times it felt as if nothing
can be better in the world. Sports are universal. No matter what country you find
yourself in there is always a sport that can be played that breaks levels of
language barriers. Below, there are links to different pages that explain different
sports that I find interesting. In those pages, there is a basic explanation of
the sport, what leagues or countries it can be found in, and what major events
the sport hosts.
