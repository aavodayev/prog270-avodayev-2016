# BASKETBALL

<p> Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular
court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in
diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end.

A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during
regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the
player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from in
front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one
point, after the other team was assessed with certain fouls. The team with the
most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) is
issued when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced
on the court by throwing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or
running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, one's pivot foot
without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands
then resume dribbling.

There are many techniques for ball handlingâ€”shooting, passing, dribbling, and
rebounding. Basketball teams generally have player positions, the tallest and
strongest members of a team are called a center or power forward, while slightly
shorter and more agile players are called small forward, and the shortest
players or those who possess the best ball handling skills are called a point
guard or shooting guard. The point guard directs the on court action of the
team, implementing the coach's game plan, and managing the execution of
offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). </p>
