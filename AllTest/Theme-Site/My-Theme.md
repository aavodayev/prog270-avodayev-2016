# Background

<p>
As a child I have always had a fascination with sports. From running, to
swimming,to playing team sports, I have always found sports to be relaxing and
fun and not a task to complete. At times it was hard and at other times it felt
as if nothing can be better in the world. Sports are universal. No matter what
country you find yourself in there is always a sport that can be played that
breaks levels of language barriers. Below, there are links to different pages
that explain different sports that I find interesting. In those pages, there is
a basic explanation of the sport, what leagues or countries it can be found in,
and what major events the sport hosts.</p>
