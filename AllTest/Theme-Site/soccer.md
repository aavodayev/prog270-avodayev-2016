# SOCCER

Soccer, more commonly known as football outside the United States,is a sport
played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played
by 250 million players in over 200 nations, making it the world's most popular
sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end.
The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands
or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area. Outfield players
mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head
or torso to do so instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of
the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is
declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending
on the format of the competition.
