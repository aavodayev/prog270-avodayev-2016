# **Hockey**

Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which
two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into
their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of 6
players each, 1 goaltender and five players who skate up and down the ice trying
 to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.
