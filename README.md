# Alexey Avodayev Prog270 Repository

Here is where I'm putting some of my files from the Prog270 Winter, 2016 class.

## Git Steps

```
git add README.md
git commit -m "My Commit" 
git push

```
Don't ever do a git commit without the dash m (-m). It opens an editor and you won't be happy when you're in it.
